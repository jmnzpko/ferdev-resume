# Fernando Jimenez — Developer Portfolio & Interactive Resume

Welcome to my personal portfolio and interactive resume!  
This repository hosts the source code for my online resume built with **React**, designed to showcase my professional experience, technical skills, and the projects I’ve worked on throughout my career.

This project is based on a customizable React resume template, which I’ve adapted to highlight my work, style, and accomplishments in a clean and modern format.
